This repository contains the backend for a flight booking application. The frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/tanishabisht/Fullstack-FlightBookingFrontend).

## Intructions to run the application

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node version: v16.20.2
- `nvm install v16.20.2`
- `nvm use v16.20.2`

Steps to run:
1. Clone the repository and open it in your preferred development environment (e.g., VS Code).
2. Create a file called `.env`, copy the content from `deploy.env`, and replace with the correct values for the variables.
3. Open the terminal in your editor and run:
   - `npm install` to install all the node packages and dependencies from [`package.json`](/package.json).
   - `node app.js` to start the server.

By following these steps, you can run the Flight Booking backend locally and integrate it with the frontend for a complete flight booking application.
